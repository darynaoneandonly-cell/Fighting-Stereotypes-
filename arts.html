Eating disorders are one of the deadliest mental illnesses around the world. Therefore, it is not a condition that it is to be joked about or treated lightly. To be honest, I did not know who to trust or to rely on when I was confused about what is happening. Professionals might be sometimes out of reach, however I realised that there is always somebody you can talk to. I personally went into research to find many contact numbers around the world that you can call or text freely when you are unsure about your mental condition. All of these phone numbers were checked by me and are trust-worthy sources. It shouldn’t be restricted to contacting only when you get diagnosed, but even when you notice experiencing similar symptoms/patterns or to simply talk to an expert when you are concerned.

You can click on the pinpoints of different countries to see the helplines. :) In order to zoom-in and out from this screen, you need to use two fingers on your touchpad (if using a laptop) and scroll down or up. Ignore the tab that might say "trial has been expired to use this map", it still works.
